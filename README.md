# Disclaimer
Although the basics of this plugin are finished, <br>
i am still working on expanding it in the coming <br>
months. If you want to be able to upgrade to the <br>
latest update, I would recommend leaving this    <br>
script unchanged. If you make changes, you have  <br>
to redo these changes if you update to the lates <br>
version of this script!                          <br>

Other than that you are free to use this script  <br>
and make changes to it. Just make sure you put   <br>
my name and GitHub link in your upload.          <br>

Have fun everyone :)
